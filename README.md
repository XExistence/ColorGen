# ColorGen
Color Stats application

## Getting Started

Starting the app
```
flutter run -d windows
```

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. I used flutter because it allows a centralized codebase as conviently deploy on other platforms with small changes that are platform specific

## Windows
This is a windows build as it uses dart:io so web and mobile would require its own custom configuration

# Why Flutter
I chose flutter because its got a really cool front end customermisation freedom with almost zero constraints and the centralized codebase
